There are two data sets here, corresponding to the files ending in '1' and '2'.

The 'coords' file contains the physiological coordinates of the areas (or nodes) in the brain which the data sets correspond to.

The 'labels' file contains the names of these nodes.

The 'mat' files contain the matrix of measured similarities (in activity) between these nodes for each data set.

The 'attributes' files contain attributes for each node in each data set.
